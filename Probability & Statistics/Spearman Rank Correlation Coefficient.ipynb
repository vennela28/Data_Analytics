    "r is PCC of rₓ and rᵧ. Ranks are strictly increasing. If you have a function strictly / monotonically increasing function i.e. <b> x increases and y increases; the relationship may be linear or non-linear - Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient, r = 1 </b>.\n",

    "If there exist any outliers in the data set, Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient handles the data elegantly. r = 0.84, ρ = 0.67 \n",

    "\n",
    "Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient is robust to the outliers than PCC because we are going in the terms of assigning ranks to the data points.\n"
